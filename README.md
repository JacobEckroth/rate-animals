## To Run Project
First make sure you have the current branch from master, then do npm install to get your node_modules folder. Then to start the server running on port 3000 do npm start.
To access pages go to localhost:3000.
If you need to add pages go into server.js and add them there. It should be pretty self explanatory how to add a page or file once you're in there.

## Note to other Contributors:
Before you start editing check out this: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging

When you're happy make a pull request with master, and text the group so we can all check it out, or if you're just adding and not removing anything feel free to just push it to master.

Also check out the projects tab, and feel free to add anything you think needs to be to any of the lists, as well as moving stuff around when you're actually working on things, so we don't have multiple people working on something at the same time.
## Changing Main Styling
To change the styling for anything that will change accross all the pages, use the navbar-style.css file within the navbarstyle folder in the root directory. This will allow for consistent displaying across the website.

## Changing Individual Page Styling
To change an individual page's styling, simply create new css file in that page's folder and link it to the page from the HTML.

## Adding temporary images.
Use this website url to add images. https://placekitten.com/
